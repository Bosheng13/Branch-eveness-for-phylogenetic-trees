# Branch-eveness-for-phylogenetic-trees
 This project provide simple python scripts to calculate the beanch evenness value (according to shannon eveness index) of a certain clade selected from a phylogeny tree. It consist of two python scripts named 'rearrange-tree.py' and 'shanon_evenness.py', and should be used in order. For first script 'rearrange-tree.py', a newick tree file (Test-tree.txt) should be prepared, and it's pathway should be edited by users in line 1 of the script (fi=open(...)). The output of 'rearrange-tree.py' (named 'Whole----trimed-tree-final.txt') should further be introduced into the 'shanon_evenness.py' with the real pathway edited (also the 'fi=open(...)' in line 1 of 'shannon_evenness.py'). The final output ('Whole--final_list.txt') of 'shannon_evenness.py' contain all the evenness data of the phylogeny tree.
