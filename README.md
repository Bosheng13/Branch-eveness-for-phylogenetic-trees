# Branch-eveness-for-phylogenetic-trees
 This project provide simple python scripts to calculate the beanch evenness value (according to shannon eveness index) of a certain clade selected from a phylogeny tree. It consist of two python scripts named 'rearrange-tree.py' and 'shannon_evenness.py', and should be used in order. For first script 'rearrange-tree.py', a newick tree file (Test-tree.txt) should be prepared, and it's pathway should be edited by users in line 1 of the script (fi=open(...)). The output of 'rearrange-tree.py' (named 'Whole----trimed-tree-final.txt') should further be introduced into the 'shannon_evenness.py' with the real pathway edited (also the 'fi=open(...)' in line 1 of 'shannon_evenness.py'). The final output ('Whole--final_list.txt') of 'shannon_evenness.py' contain all the evenness data of the phylogeny tree.
1. file 'Test-tree.txt' is the initial input file containing newick tree data.
2. file 'Whole----trimed-tree-final.txt' is the output file of script 'rearrange-tree.py'
3. file 'Whole--final_list.txt' is the final evenness output generated by script 'shannon_evenness.py', rowname of this file refers the initial leaf selected by this method, and colnames indicate number of leaves used to calculate the evenness index. The average value of each column (average evenness value of each subclade in the provide newick tree) could be used as the final result.
